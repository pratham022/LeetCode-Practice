- Since we can perform the transaction only one time, we will try to buy the stock at the lowest price and sell it at the maximum price
- So, keep a variable `minCost` to hold the minimum price upto `i`
- Also, keep a variable `maxProfit`.
- At every `i`, calculate `maxProfit = max(maxProfit, prices[i] - minCost);`
- Also update `minCost = min(minCost, prices[i]);`
